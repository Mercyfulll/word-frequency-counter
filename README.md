Python Test 1:
Create a function that checks if a passed-in string is valid for a given regular expression. Accepted strings must be at least 6 characters long where at least 2 of the characters are numbers but no more than 3 are numbers. There must also be at least 1 non-numerical character in between each number. 

Python Test 2:
Create a Python program that reads a string of text, counts the frequency of each word, and then displays the words in descending order of their frequency.



Example input:



text = "Hello world! This is a test. Hello, this test is only a test."



Example output:



Word Frequencies:

test: 3

hello: 2

this: 2

is: 2

a: 2

world: 1

only: 1
